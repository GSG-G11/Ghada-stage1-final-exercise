# Elements of Software Design in Javascript
## :rocket: Stage 1

 
This first stage concerns itself with fundamental concepts of JavaScript that most design patterns will be built upon. We recommend that you are comfortable with these concepts before moving on to other stages.

## :eyes: Final Exercise Stage 1;

This is [the final exercise](https://https://github.com/GSG-CA/ws-software-design-js/tree/master/stage-1/exercise) of stage 1. You have been given a small working app. To try it out, open the index.html file in this directory in your browser.

Your task is to refactor the app's JavaScript using the principles and techniques that have been covered in the rest of stage 1. This is an open-ended exercise, there is no defined solution or "end-point" (unless you run out of time); you must use your judgement to decide when you've arrived at a satisfactory solution.

First take a few minutes to understand what the code is doing, then use what you have learned in the preceding stage-1 exercises to refactor the app. Take your time, and think about what principles you are trying to apply while you are refactoring.
